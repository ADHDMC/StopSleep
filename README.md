You hate beds? Wish the night was never ending? Want players to deal with phantoms and stop avoiding their problems? Well here you go- Stop Sleep is here to do just that, stop sleeping

People can still set spawnpoints though, so, if you also wanna prevent that you should probably use something else.

There are 3 permissions:

`stopsleep.bypass`

> so that this person can still sleep even when the other people can't

`stopsleep.silent`

> so that you don't have to deal with my stupid messages 

`stopsleep.reload`
> uh reload the config
